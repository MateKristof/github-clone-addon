VS Code Icon Reference

The icon used in the extension's UI is a simplified VS Code logo SVG embedded directly in the content.js file.

For a complete extension package, you would need:

1. Full VS Code icon SVG (this can be used as a reference for creating the PNG icons)
2. PNG icons in the icons directory (16x16, 48x48, 128x128)

The VS Code logo is primarily blue (#007ACC) with a stylized "code" symbol that resembles a "<>" with a break in the middle.
